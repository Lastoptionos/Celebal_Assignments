# Week 6 Assignments : 
## Create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express that supports basic CRUD operations on a resource (like users, products, etc.)
### Some Commands to use in the terminal :
* node -v
* npm-v
* npm init -y
* npm install express
* node index.js

### Use Postman or another API client : 
#### We'll perform the following operations :
#### 1) POST /users: Creates a new user.
#### 2) GET /users: Retrieves all users.
#### 3) GET /users/:id: Retrieves a single user by ID.
#### 4) PUT /users/:id: Updates a user by ID.
#### 5) DELETE /users/:id: Deletes a user by ID.
